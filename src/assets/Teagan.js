At such a place, you receive free lodging and food of a modest or comfortable standard (depending on the quality of the establishment), as long as you perform each night. In addition, your performance makes you something of a local figure. When strangers recognize you in a town where you have performed, they typically take a liking to you.\n\nSettling a Score:\n\"Ironsights\" is the guy who sold you out --DEAD--\n\"Grik\" is the \"Raider Boss\"\n\nSkill Expert (Feat)\nYou have honed your proficiency with particular skills, granting you the following benefits:\n\nIncrease one ability score of your choice by 1, to a maximum of 20.\nYou gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.\nChoose one skill in which you have proficiency. You gain expertise with that skill, which means your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make with it. The skill you choose must be one that isn't already benefiting from a feature, such as Expertise, that doubles your proficiency bonus.\n\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\n\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a musical instrument (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\n\nBardic Inspiration\nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\n\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.\n\nMagical Inspiration (Optional)\nAt 2nd level, if a creature has a Bardic Inspiration die from you and casts a spell that restores hit points or deals damage, the creature can roll that die and choose a target affected by the spell. Add the number rolled as a bonus to the hit points regained or the damage dealt. The Bardic Inspiration die is then lost.\n\nJack of All Trades\nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.\n\nSong of Rest\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\n\nThe extra Hit Points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\n\nSilver Tongue\nStarting at 3rd level, you are a master at saying the right thing at the right time. When you make a Charisma (Persuasion) or Charisma (Deception) check, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\n\nUnsettling Words\nAlso at 3rd level, you can spin words laced with magic that unsettle a creature and cause it to doubt itself. As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Roll the Bardic Inspiration die. The creature must subtract the number rolled from the next saving throw it makes before the start of your next turn.\n\nExpertise\nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\n\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.\n\nCountercharm\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).\n\nUnfailing Inspiration\nAt 6th level, your inspiring words are so persuasive that others feel driven to succeed. When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the roll fails, the creature can keep the Bardic Inspiration die.\n\nUniversal Speech\nAlso at 6th level, you have gained the ability to make your speech intelligible to any creature. As an action, choose one or more creatures within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). The chosen creatures can magically understand you, regardless of the language you speak, for 1 hour.\n\nOnce you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot to use it again.\n", "skill_modifiers": { "acrobatics": { "name": "Acrobatics", "raw": "dex", "expert": false, "proficent": true }, "animal_handling": { "name": "Animal Handling", "raw": "wis", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "arcana": { "name": "Arcana", "raw": "int", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "athletics": { "name": "Athletics", "raw": "str", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "deception": { "name": "Deception", "raw": "chr", "expert": true, "proficent": true }, "history": { "name": "History", "raw": "int", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "insight": { "name": "Insight", "raw": "wis", "expert": false, "proficent": true }, "intimidation": { "name": "Intimidation", "raw": "chr", "expert": true, "proficent": true }, "investigation": { "name": "Investigation", "raw": "int", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "medicine": { "name": "Medicine", "raw": "wis", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "nature": { "name": "Nature", "raw": "int", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "perception": { "name": "Perception", "raw": "wis", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "performance": { "name": "Performance", "raw": "chr", "expert": false, "proficent": true }, "persuasion": { "name": "Persuasion", "raw": "chr", "expert": false, "proficent": true }, "religon": { "name": "Religon", "raw": "int", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "sleight_of_hand": { "name": "Sleight of Hand", "raw": "dex", "expert": true, "proficent": true }, "stealth": { "name": "Stealth", "raw": "dex", "expert": false, "proficent": false }, "survival": { "name": "Survival", "raw": "wis", "expert": false, "proficent": false } } }, "healthData": { "maxHP": 63, "currentHP": 63, "defaultAC": "15", "currentAC": "15", "hitdie": "7d8" }, "exp": 23720, "magicData": { "spells": { "Vicious Mockery": { "name": "Vicious Mockery", "level": "Cantrip", "ctime": "1 Action", "ritual": "no", "concentration": "no", "school": "Enchantment", "description": "You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range.
